1. Recipe App: A simple recipe app that allows users to search for recipes. Users will be able to add recipes to their profile for easy access later. Users will be able to search for recipes by ingredients, cuisine, and diet, among other potential things. There will also be a "recommendations" section that will suggest recipes based on the user's previous searches and saved recipes. Could go farther by incorporating youtube api to find and display videos of the recipe being made, or an api to send emails with recipes.

2. Crime data app: allows users to search for crime data. Users can search by location, crime type, and date. Relevant news articles will be shown based on the search criteria, which users can save to their profile.

3. News app: allows users to search for news articles based on keywords. Users can save articles to their profile. Would incorporate youtube api to show videos of news stories. Would also include recommendations based on the user's saved articles.
